# Optimizing Taxi Fleet at JFK Airport

**Description**
This project focuses on optimizing the number of taxis stationed at JFK International Airport in New York City. The dataset used comprises 300,000 taxi journeys recorded in 2016. The objective is to determine the ideal number of taxis to be stationed at the airport during different hours of the day and days of the week to maximize revenue for the taxi company.

**Project Steps:**
1. **Importing and Cleaning Data:** The dataset is imported and cleaned using pandas. Data types are optimized for memory efficiency, and any missing or erroneous values are handled.

2. **Selecting Data:** Data is filtered to extract taxi journeys originating from JFK Airport based on geographic coordinates.

3. **Proportion of Airport Journeys:** The proportion of taxi journeys starting at JFK Airport is calculated relative to all locations.

4. **Visualizing Starting Points:** A visualization is created to show the distribution of taxi journey starting points in New York City, highlighting JFK Airport.

5. **Proportion of Airport Journeys on Each Day:** The proportion of taxi journeys starting at JFK Airport is calculated for each day of the week.

6. **Proportion of Journeys on Each Day of the Week:** Visualizations are created to compare the proportion of taxi journeys on each day of the week, both from all locations and from JFK Airport.

7. **Proportion of Journeys Each Hour:** Visualizations are created to compare the proportion of taxi journeys at different hours of the day, both from all locations and from JFK Airport.

8. **Customizing Visualizations:** Visualizations are customized for improved clarity and aesthetic appeal using matplotlib.

9. **Making a Recommendation:** Based on the analysis, recommendations are provided regarding the optimal number of taxis to be stationed at JFK Airport for each hour and day of the week.

**Key Skills Utilized:**
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Data Visualization
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Python Programming (Pandas, Matplotlib)

**Outcome:**
The project provides insights into taxi demand patterns at JFK Airport, enabling the taxi company to optimize fleet allocation for maximum efficiency and profitability. By strategically adjusting the number of taxis stationed at the airport based on time and day, the company can better meet customer demand and increase revenue.
